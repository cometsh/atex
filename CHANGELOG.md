## [Unreleased]

### Breking Changes

- `deflexicon` now converts all def names to be in snake_case instead of the
  casing as written the lexicon.

### Added

- `deflexicon` now emits structs for records, objects, queries, and procedures.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-11

### Breaking Changes

- Remove `Atex.HTTP` and associated modules as the abstraction caused a bit too
  much complexities for how early atex is. It may come back in the future as
  something more fleshed out once we're more stable.
- Rename `Atex.XRPC.Client` to `Atex.XRPC.LoginClient`

### Added

- `Atex.OAuth` module with utilites for handling some OAuth functionality.
- `Atex.OAuth.Plug` module (if Plug is loaded) which provides a basic but
  complete OAuth flow, including storing the tokens in `Plug.Session`.
- `Atex.XRPC.Client` behaviour for implementing custom client variants.
- `Atex.XRPC` now supports using different client implementations.
- `Atex.XRPC.OAuthClient` to make XRPC calls on the behalf of a user who has
  authenticated with ATProto OAuth.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- `Atex.Lexicon` module that provides the `deflexicon` macro, taking in a JSON
  Lexicon definition and converts it into a series of schemas for each
  definition within it.
- `mix atex.lexicons` for converting lexicon JSON files into modules using
  `deflexicon` easily.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-29

### Changed

- `Atex.XRPC.Adapter` renamed to `Atex.HTTP.Adapter`.

### Added

- `Atex.HTTP` module that delegates to the currently configured adapter.
- `Atex.HTTP.Response` struct to be returned by `Atex.HTTP.Adapter`.
- `Atex.IdentityResolver` module for resolving and validating an identity,
  either by DID or a handle.
  - Also has a pluggable cache (with a default ETS implementation) for keeping
    some data locally.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added

- `Atex.TID` module for manipulating ATProto TIDs.
- `Atex.Base32Sortable` module for encoding/decoding numbers as
  `base32-sortable` strings.
- Basic XRPC client.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-07
